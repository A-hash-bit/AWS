Ec2 have multiple storage options. like instance store, EBS, EFS, S3.
 - selection depends on requirement - performance, durability.

By default AMI deteremine if u get EBS or instance store as root vol.
*EBS - elastic block storage
 - provides block level storage.
 - similar to hard drive, raw block device
 - Can mount these vol. as device to EC2.
 - If its root volume (bydefault its ephimeral, while creating EC2 configure to not delete with instance.)
 - If attach as additional vol. then its persistant.

 # When to use
  1. quick access of data.
  2. long term persistence.
  3. for file system, DB

* Need EC2 and vol in same AZ
  - only one to one mapping of EC2-EBS at one time, detach and attach to another instance is possible.
  - if want to attach to EC2 in diff. AZ then take SnapShot, create new vol from that snapshot in req. AZ and use.
  - not encrypted by default at rest, but can use KMS for encryption.
  - can create Snapshot(Backups) of EBS and get stored in S3.
  - can use cloud watch to get diff. metrics for EBS vol. for monitoring
  
  # Types of EBS
   1. General purpose SSD.(gp2,gp3)
      - balance between price & preformance(IOPS).
      - use as boot vol., medium size single instance DB, dev/test env.
   2. Provisioned IOPS SSD.(io1,io2)
      - need for intense IO workloads, consistance IOPS
  * HHD is magnetic storage
   3. Throughput Optimised HDD(st1) 
      - low cost, better throughput
      - log processing, data warehouse, ETL etc. large data
   4. Cold HDD(sc1)
      - lower cost, infrequent access, little high latency

  ++++++++++ Instance store Vs EBS ++++++++++++
  * Both are block level storage.
  * Depends on AMI.
  * EBS is permanent, instance store is not.
  * Can take snapshot of EBS, not for Instance store.
  * Encription for EBS is possible but not for Instance store.
  * EBS have type, Instance store is on HDD

  =============================================
  How to create and attach EBS.
   1. while creating EC2 instance add EBS as storage (no more configuration req.) - u can check with df -h, and look for vol. device name.
   2. after ec2 is already created.
    - go to volume, create vol. in same AZ as EC2., now attach it to Instance(via action).
    - now need to mount this vol.
      - lsblk (list all block devices mounted/not mounted)
      - create a dir (mkidr /my-vol)
      - create filesystem for the new vol. (mkfs -t ext4 /(device name))- its a one time task, if u do it again u will loose data
        * device name gets created when we create vol., check name in vol.
      - mount /device-name /my-vol
   3. if need to delete/detach the vol
      - umount /device-name  (unmount)
      - then detach from vol section
