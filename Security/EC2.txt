* How to secure EC2 instance?
 1. Use strong IAM role for least privilages.
 2. Create custom VPC for EC2 isolation.
 3. Configure firewall, Security group for EC2. its stateful. accept/deny req. from particular IPs.
 4. NACL at subnet level. its stateless, need to configure inbound and outbound both.
 5. use SSH key-value pair for cli access, username/passwd is old way. 
 6. Put sensitive server in private subnet for isolation.
 7. Regular patched and updates for EC2.
 8. Never use Root access or admin access for any user, give specific access.
 9. Encrypt data, use EBS (by default EBS data id encrypted at rest, KMS create data-key and encrypt data before storing).
 10. MFA.
 11. Monitoring - Cloud watch alarm for suspicious activity.
 12. Limit metadata access.
 13. Use bastion server (req. to EC2 goes through bastion, it authenticate and authorise the req.)
 14. reguler data backup, if lost or deleted by accident/hacker.
 15. Close unused ports.
 16. AWS inspector - It run security assessments to identify vulnerabilities.
 17. WAF/AWS sheild for DDoS protection, especially for internet facing instances.
     - AWS WAF(Web Application Firewall) provides protection on the application layer and AWS Shield protects the infrastructure layers of the OSI model.
 18. regular check for IAM Roles/Users/Policies
 19. Regular audits to identify weaknesses.
 20. Trusted Advisor - revive aws setup gives recommendations.
