* to migrate DB from on-prem to AWS Cloud 
 - Use - DMS (Database Migration service)
        - it securely migrate DB to aws, resilient, self healing.
        - from one type of DB to same type of DB (oracle to oracle, sql to sql etc.)
        - from one type to other type (from oracle to postgress etc..)
        - Continious data replication using CDC. (continious data capture)
        - Need to create a ec2 instance to perform migration/replication from source DB to Target DB.
        - if source and target DB engines are different then only need to use SCT(schema conversion tool). so DMS+SCT (SCT will be installed on on-prem), DMS instance in public subnet.
        - DMS instance is multi AZ.

In AWS DMS UI for DMS instance - 1. Give name.
                2. Choose replication instance type (as per amount of data for fast relication.)
                3. Storage, VPC, If multi AZ, KMS key for encryption.
Then create source and target endpoints.
then create new DB migration task - 
* we can migrate whole data or only new/changed data

* Migrate from RDS to Aurora
- 1. RDS MySQL DB snapshot -> restore Aurora MySql DB (downtime as RDS need to stop)
  2. Create Aurora read replica from RDS and then when lag is 0 make read replica as main Aurora instance. more cost for data transfer.
  3. Create a backup file put it in S3 --> from that craate new Aurora cluster.
  4. Create MYSql dump ---> sned to Aurora and create new DB cluster.
  5. Or use AWS DMS service.
