* Disaster Recovery
- DR is about preparing for and recovering from a disaster.
- how to do DR
  - On-premises - having secondary infra. on On-premises  , costly.
  - Hybrid - having cloud as secondary infra.
  - Full cloud - both infra on cloud.

* RPO - recovery point objective - last point till where we can recover(last backup) -  data loss
* RTO - recovery time objective - after disaster in how much time we can recover. - downtime

* DR Startegies
- Backup and Restore - High RPO, High RTO, Less cost, need only storage cost.
- Pilot Light - Small copy of ur infra and application is always running on cloud,ur DB is constantly coping from main db but EC2 is not running. thus small RTO/RPO, just failover to other instance from route53.
- Warm Standby - system running with minimum size but can be scale to production level. secondary DB will always keep replication data from main DB
- Hot Site/ Multi Site Approach - having full prodution scale system running, low RTO.RPO, high cost. secondary DB will always keep replication data from main DB.

* Backups- 1. EBS snapshots, RDS auto backup/snapshots
           2. Push data to s3(use lifecycle), cross region replication.
           3. use snowball/storage gateway to copy data from on-premises.
* High availability- 1. Use route53 for failover routing
                     2. RDS multi AZ, Elastic cache Multi AZ etc.
                     3. Have site-to-site VPN as backup for AWS direct connect.
* Replication - 1. RDS cross region replication, AWS aurora + global DB
                2. DB replication from on-prem to RDS
                3. Storage gateway
* Automation- IAC tool to re-create new env.
