* There are 2 type of migration Cold & live , Cold when VM is stopped, Live when VM is running.
# 1 - VM migration (from private data center)
Steps - 1. Create/Get VMDK file (Its a kind of backup file of VM)
        2. Create an S3 bucket. & upload the vmdk file to s3.
        3. Create a IAM Role(named -"vmimport") for EC2 with permission of (VM import export full access) and edit trust relationship to "vmie" instead of "ec2"
            - (so that it can convert the vmdk to AMI)  - need to give ec2 and s3 full access but if import cmd don't work May need to give admin access
        4. configure the AWS user (install AWS cli if not) where the VM is. 
        5. Create a json file on the system where the VM is. (containers.json)
        [{
          "Description": "<migration>",
          "Format": "vmdk",
          "UserBucket"{
              "S3Bucket": "<bucket name>",
              "S3Key": "<object-name-in-bucket>"
          }}]
      6. run the following cmd
      -> aws ec2 import-image --description "<migration>" --disk-containers "file://<path/to/containers.json>"   (it will create AMI from vmdk)
      -> aws ec2 describe-import-image-tasks --import-task-ids <ami-id>   (get ami-id from O/P of above task) - to monitor the progress.
      7. go to ec2 -->AMI --> find ur new image (import-ami-..)
      8. Now launch a new instance from this ami 
      9. SSH to ec2 with same creads that ur VM has

    # 2 - DB Migration (from private data center)
        - Go To DB migration service (DMS)
          - create replication instance (we can do on demand or scheduled)  -Create a role For DMS with admin or required access.
          - Create Endpoints (source abd target)
          - Create DB migration task (select if u want to migrate old data/ old+running data/ only new data)
