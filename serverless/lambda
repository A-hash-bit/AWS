* In serverless developers don't need to manage servers. just deploy code or just deploy functions.

* In lambda no neeed to manage servers, good for short executions, run on demand, automatic scaling , so low cost.
  - Only pay for per request and compute time.
  - integration with all aws services - main ones - API gateway, kenesis, dynamoDB/s3(lambda can be triggred by them), cloudfront, cloud watch events/event bridge, cloud watch logs, sns, sqs, cognito
  - easy monitoring through AWS Cloudwatch.
  - easy to get more resources per function(up to 10 GB of RAM) - if u increase RAM then it improve CPU and Network.
  - multiple language support.(nodejs,python,java,C#,go,Ruby and open source(like Rust) and lambda image container(image must implement lambda runtime api))

  ============================
  Create lambda-
  1. first we create lambda function (give name, select runtime, copy/write code)
  2. create test event(click on test button )event is a JSON object that mocks the structure of requests emitted by AWS services to invoke a Lambda function. no need if there is some other service is 
     invoking lambda func. lambda need some event to invoke.
  3. by default lambda create a role which helps lambda to create log group(cloud watch), and write logs into that group.
  4. in monitor section we can see some metrics(invokes, errors, throttles..) and cloud watch logs.
  5. In configuration --> permission (IAM role and its access).

  ===========================
  Limits in lambda (limits are per region)
  *execution
    -  memory allocation(RAM) - 128mb - 10 gb(1 mb increment), when we increase RAM we get more vCPU (vCPU is proportional to RAM)
    -  max execution/timeout time 15 min.
    -  default timeout is 3 sec.
    -  env var 4kb
    -  Disk capacity (/tmp folder) - 512mb to 10gb
    -  1000 concurrent executions(can be increased)
  * Deplyement
    - deployment size (compressed zip) - 50 mb
    - deployment size (uncompressed code+dependancies) - 250 mb
    - can use /tmp directory to load other files at startup.
    - env var 4kb
=================================================

* Lambda SnapStart (Its a lambda feature) - improves lambda func. performance upto 10X with no extra cost for java 11 and above.
 - without SnapStart - steps -1. code initialisation  2. code invocation 3. shutdown
 - with SnapStart - skip the init step (no initialise from scratch which takes a lot of time)
 * when u deploy/publish new version lambda initialize ur func/code and take snapshot of memory and dick state. and cached for future use.

 ===============================================
 * Lambda@Edge and cloudfront functions
 - modern app execute some logic at edge location.
 - Edge function - is the code that runs at edge location, which is attatched to cloudfront distributions.
 * CloudFront provide 2 types: Lambda@Edge & Cloudfront functions.
 - no need to manage server(fully serverless), deployed globally.
 *Use case: -customize CDN content.
            -Website security and privacy.
            -search engine optimization.
            -real time image Transformation.
            -user authentication and authorisation etc.

* CloudFront Function-
  client -->(viewer req.)-->Cloudfront-->(origin req.)-->Server then server-->(origin res.)-->Cloudfront-->(viewer res.)-->client (common CF working)
  - lightweight function written in JS.
  - for high scale, latency sensitive CDN customization.
  - mil. of req./sec.
  - change after getting viewer req. or before viewer res.(these are triggers for function)
  -native cloudfront feature.
  - execution time <1ms (less time for logic)
  - Max memory - 2mb
  - packet size - 10kb
*function/usecase
  - Cache key normalization.(Transform request attributes) to create optimal cache key.
  - header manipulation in req. or res.
  - URL rewrite or redirect.
  - for autho. and authen. - create, validate JWT token, to allow/deny req.

* Lambda@Edge -
 - written in nodejs, python
 - scales to 1000s of req/sec
 - change after getting viewer req. or before viewer res. or before forward to server or after getting response from server.
 - author ur function in us-east-1 region, then cloudfront replicates it to its locations.(these are triggers for function)
 - execution time 5-10 sec (more complex logic can be used.)
 - Max memory - 128mb-10gb
 - packet size - 1mb-50mb
* Function/use
 - longer execution time
 - more CPU,Memory
 - file system access, network access so more complex logic

 ========================================
 * lambda networking
 - by default lambda function launched in aws-owned vpc, not in ur vpc or default vpc.
 - so it cannot access resources in ur VPC (RDS, Elastic cache, Internal ELB..)
 - it can access public resources (like DynamoDB)
 - so launch lambda in VPC - pass VPC ID, subnet and SG.
 - so lambda will create an ENI, via that it will access vpc resources.
===========================================
* Lambda with RDS proxy (Use case)
- u can have multiple lambda accessing RDS at one, if multiple connection opening and closing will make many open connection.
- if u directly connect to RDS in VPC, in future u will have many lambda thus many connections to RDS which can make RDS performance bad.(High load on DB)
- So we create RDS proxy, it take many connections and make calls to main RDS.
  Adv:- 1. Improve scalability by pooling and sharing DB connection.
        2. Improve Availability by reducing 66% failover time and preserving connection.(RDS and Aurora)
        3. security - IAM auth. at proxy level, store creds at secret manager.
- need to create lambda in VPC, as RDS proxy is private.
- lambda can be in public/private subnet as per req.
- open req. ports in security group.
============================================
* Lambda and RDS/Aurora integration
- we can invoke lambda function from within your DB instance.
- works for RDS(Postgress) and Aurora(MySQL)
- Use case - user does registration(signup page)--> data entry to registration table -->To invoke Lambda--> send welcome notification.
- Need to setup this configuration, need to go inside of DB, not from console.
- lambda security group needs to have RDS port open in inbound.
- DB need permission to invoke lambda(IAM policy).
- RDS Event Notification-
  - it tells about DB instance - (created,stopped, strted..)
