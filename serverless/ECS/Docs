ECS is managed container orchestrator (like docker swarm, k8s)
- orchestrator - to manage lifecycle of containers Create/restart/destroy. Get resource/server for containers.
               - Deploy and Load balance application across multiple servers.
               - Auto scale as per traffic.
               - Rolling out changes without downtime.

* With docker compose wwe can deploy docker cont. on one server only.

## ECS architeture
* ECS has 2 launch type
  - EC2 - we have to manages ec2, install docker, install ecs agent so ecs control plane will talk to nodes, install firewall so certain ports will be open, patches.
        - ecs is like control plane and clutser are nodes where u deploy.
        - more control
  - Fargate - aws will manage underlying infra.
            - now we will have ecs control plane, cluster and fargate.
            - fargate will create servers on demand by ecs inside the cluster.
            - pay what u use.
* ECS cluster - ECS just know how ur app. will get deployed but doesn't have any other service(servers and other resource), its can just create/delete containers. 
                but it needs underlying infra.
                cluster is that resource, bunch of servers. and ecs is responsible to deploy it on those servers.
* Ecs task defination - blueprint on how ur container should launch, how much CPU/Mem, Image/Ports/Volumes.
* Task - is instance of task defination.
* ECS service - it ensure that a cretain no of tasks are running at all times, restart cont. that have exited/crashed. create new insance if one fails.
* Load balancers - take an LB assign it to service.

* Create Cluster - give name, choose ec2 (asg, OS,AMI,Networking,SG etc....), fargate, External instances using ECS Anywhere.
                 - monitoring - enable conatiner insight for server metrics.
