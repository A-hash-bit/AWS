* In simple terms API is an intermidiatory between two applications that allows them to communicate with each other.
eg. food delivery app- where via api it access maps.
    payment option in apps uses payment api.

* Types of APIs
  - Http - api for web server/browser, it can be public or private (private api requires access token)
  - REST (Representational State transfer) 
    - Rest api are http apis but not all http api are rest.
    - it is flexible, rest is not tied to methods and resources so can handle multiple types of call and handle different data formats.
  - Web Socket - allow to create web socket which is capable of bidirectional full duplex communication over persistent TCP connection (written in JS) - eg. chat apps,streaming dashoard.

* What is API gateway
- its like a API management tool that is a computer software that sits between client and collection of backend services. it is a single entry point for all backend apis/micro-services.
- If API is not consistant in delivering then its useless, hence API gateway is built to provide security and high availability. and does authentication and authorisation of user
- API gateways control access to APIs to protect them, reduce API abuse, and increase their value. Additionally, an API gateway add an insulation layer between providers and consumers of APIs. 
  At a high level, an API gateway: Authorizes and authenticates: Ensures secure access to APIs and who (authorize) can call APIs.
- eg. of API gateways - aws API gateway, redhat 3scale, apigee, mulesoft

* AWS API Gateway-
- its aws service for creating, publishing, monitoring and maintaining REST, HTTP and websocket APIs.
- API devlopers can create apis that access AWS or other web service, as well as data stored in aws cloud.

* working of AWS API Gateway.
  1. there can be many API so API gateway take care of authentication and authorization.
  2. u may have to set limit(rate limiting, quotas) for api consumers.
  3. implement multiple versions of ur API.
  4. monitor API calls.
  5. cache ur API req. for improved performance.
 - for all this AWS API gateway works as abstract layer.

* developers uses existing microservice API's for development so they need API gateway
